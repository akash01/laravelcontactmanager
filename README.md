laravelcontactmanager
=====================

*A simple mock-up application of laravel*
  This application uses laravel 4 as back-end, backbone as front-end, require js to optimise and minify js code and   
  bootstrap 3 for css. It also uses toastr for nice validation error.
  
*To run this application*
- Clone it.
- Make sure you have laravel 4. Use composer update to update your laravel in case.
- Make dataabase with php artisan migrate or use contactmanager.sql in case.
- If you are using PHP > 5 then cd laravelcontactmanager/public and run php -S localhost:80 .
- Go to localhost:80 in your browser and there you are , your application is up and running.
- Happy Coding :)
